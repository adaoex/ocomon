Requirements:
-------------
Miminum:
* PHP 4.1 or higher
* GD 1.8.x or GD 2.10 or higher

Recommended:
* PHP 4.3.4 
* Builtin GD library in PHP 4.3.4

Installation
------------
0. Make sure your PHP is AT LEAST 4.1 (preferrable 4.3.1) 
   and that you have compiled support for GD library. 
   You must make aboslutely sure that you have GD working. 
   Please run phpinfo() to check if GD library
   is supported in your installation. If you don't have the GD library
   please consult the PHP manual under section "Image" for
   instructions on where to find this library.
   
1. Unzip and copy the files to a directory of your choice. For
   a global installation you should copy the files to 
   somewhere in the PHP search path. 

2. Check that the default directory paths in jpgraph.php 
   for cache directory and TTF directory suits your installation. 
   Note1: The default directories are different depending on if
   the library is running on Windows or UNIX.
   Note2: Apache/PHP must have write permission to your cache 
   directory if you enable the cache feature. By default the cache
   is disabled.

3. Check that all rest of the DEFINE in the top of JpGraph.php 
   is setup to your preference. The default should be fine
   for most users. (See also Note 3. below)
   
4. Make sure PHP have write privileges to your cache directory if 
   you plan on using the cache feature.

5. Read (really!) the FAQ on http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpg_faq.php.


Troubleshooting
---------------
1. If you don't get any background images (but rather a solid black
   box) you are using GD 2.x but have forgotten to enable truecolor
   support. Correct this by enabling the USE_TRUECOLOR define.

2. If background images does not work make sure the settings of 
   USE_GD2_LIBRARY corresponds to your installation, i.e. If you
   don't have GD2 then this define must be false!

3. If you are running IIS and Win2k and get the error "Can't find
   font' when trying to use TTF fonts then try to change you paths
   to UNIX style, i.e. "/usr/local/fonts/ttf/". Remember that the
   path is absolute and not relative to the htdocs catalogue. Some 
   versions of GD for Windows also need you to set the environment
   variable GDFONTPATH for GD to find the fonts.

4. If you are using the cache please make sure that you have
   set the permissions correctly for the cache directory so that
   Apache/PHP can write to that directory.

5. Some windows installations seems to have a problem with a PHP
   script ending in a newline (This newline seems to be sent to the
   browser and will cause a Header already sent error). 
   If you have this problem try remove all trailing newlines in the
   jpgraph* files
